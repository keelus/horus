# Horus
Horus is a project I decided to make to be able to control the ws281B Led Strip that I installed on my house from anywhere (usually for my computer or phone). The led strip is attached to the Raspberry Pi, so, I the project focuses in that.

Horus has a well made user interface (compatible with mobile devices) that lets the user log in, and control the led strip & view your Pi's stats (cpu temperature, ram usage, etc).

## ü§î FAQ
#### Why do Horus need sudo privileges?

To be able to control ws281x Led strip, Horus needs access to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO, where the strip is connected. Also, the web server is initialized by default on port 80 (which is a privileged port on linux).
